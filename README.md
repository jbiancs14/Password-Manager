# Password-Manager

This is my first personal coding project. It is a password manager written 
in Python which stores usernames/emails and passwords to corresponding 
websites/softwares. I used SQlite for my DB and tkinter and some encryption 
library. I used what I learned in CIS151, and thank you to Raxo and Tony for 
helping and inspiring me to create my first piece of software that I will actually use in everyday life.
